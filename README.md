CamCursor
=========

Control the mouse with a webcam and laser pointer

1. Point the webcam at the wall you will be projecting on.
2. Shine the laser at the upper lefthand corner and simultaneously click the left button.
3. Repeat step 2 for each corner in a clockwise fashion. This will set the boundaries of the
   screen to be monitored.

To use the mouse now simply shine the laser near the current location of the cursor and drag.
